## Initial Specification

You will be building a program that will allow a user to sort a randomised array. The general flow of the application is:
1. The user is presented with a number of sort algorithms to choose from
2. Decision is given via the command line (Scanner)
3. The program will then ask for the length of an array again via the command line (Scanner)
4. The program should then output:
- The unsorted randomly generated array
- The sort algorithm to be used
- The sorted array after the algorithm has been executed
- The time taken

You are required to test both the functionality of the program and the performance of the algorithms (speed tests)
